        We thank you for visiting our site and invite you to join us in our mission
        to provide hope to our neighbors on the Coastside. Coastside Hope was established
        in 1976 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit human services agency to benefit the residents
        of the San Mateo County Coastside. The agency was previously known as the
        Coastside Opportunity Center but changed our name in 2006 to better reflect
        what we bring to our clients … hope for a better life and a more secure future.
        Our Mission: Coastside Hope’s mission is to offer basic life necessities with
        dignity and hope to mid-coast residents. Our guiding principle is “Necessities
        for today, Opportunites for tomorrow.” We provide: Necessities in the form
        of food, clothing, housing assistance, online application for government benefits,
        referrals, and other support when neighbors need it most; Opportunities in
        the form of free citizenship classes, free tax preparation services, and connections
        to programs and services of other organizations so that neighbors have the
        chance to achieve more. We strengthen families and our community at large
        through our direct services and our partnerships with local agencies, businesses,
        schools, civic organizations, and faith groups. All services are provided
        on a non-discriminatory basis, and we do not charge a fee for any of our safety
        net programs. Each year we touch the lives of more than 15% of the people
        in our service area, serving over 3,500 people including more than 1,500 children.","email":null,"funding_sources":[],"licenses":[],"name":"Coastside
