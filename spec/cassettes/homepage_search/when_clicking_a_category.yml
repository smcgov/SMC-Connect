        Social Security benefits are based on the worker''s wages and may be paid
        to the worker or the worker''s dependents or survivors. People in need of
        cash aid who are age 65 or over, or who are blind or disabled including blind
        and disabled children, may apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI
        recipients automatically qualify for Medi-Cal. Medicare is the federal health
        insurance program for people age 65 or over and those who are disabled or
        have chronic kidney disease. It is best to check first the Web site for information
        about qualifications and the necessary documentation which must be submitted.
        Interim emergency financial assistance may be obtained from the San Mateo
        County Human Services Agency. Applications for homebound persons can be handled
