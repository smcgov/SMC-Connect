        Each adult mentor makes a one-year commitment to spend a minimum of three
        hours per week with the youth. In preparation for the matching, adults attend
        an information session and mentor training concentrating on an overview of
        the program and working with youth. Adult volunteers also receive support
        through weekly contacts with a trained program coordinator. Life skills training
        and support groups are also available.  Children voluntarily enter the program
        and may be referred by the Probation Department, social workers, schools or
        other youth professionals. Comprehensive year-round activities for Junior
        and Senior Friends include recreational, educational, community service and
        cultural experiences at little or no cost. Volunteers are informed of special
        program news and events through a monthly newsletter and an annual report

        Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Program requires developers of housing complexes
        with five or more units to set aside a percentage of those units at below-market
        rates and/or pay a fee that is deposited in the BMR Housing Fund. Persons
        who live or work in Menlo Park can apply to be put on the BMR waiting list.
        To be eligible to purchase or rent a BMR unit, a household must be low to
        moderate income.   A First-Time Homebuyer Second Mortgage loan is available
        to persons who have lived or worked in Menlo Park for at least one year including
        current residents. This loan, called PAL (Purchase Assistance Loan), can provide
        up to 20% of a home''s purchase price, or $75,000, whichever amount is less.
        This loan is used in addition to a market rate first mortgage to help purchase
        a home in Menlo Park. PAL has a 35 year loan term. The first five years of
        the loan are at 0% interest with no payments required. The following 30 years
        require monthly payments at 5% interest. To be eligible to receive a PAL loan
        a person or household must be low to moderate income. Menlo Park has a Housing
        Rehabilitation Loan Program for very low and low income homeowners in Menlo
        Park. Provides an affordable loan to owner-occupants for the purpose of home
        rehabilitation and repair. The loan has a 15 year term at an interest rate
        of 3%. A deferred payment option is also available. Another loan program is
        available to owners of rental units with low income occupants. The Emergency
        Repair Loan (ERL) program provides very low and low income Menlo Park homeowners
        with an affordable loan that provides for emergency repair of hazardous/unsafe
        housing conditions. The program provides an ERL loan for up to $10,000 and
        an interest rate of 3% with a loan term of 5 years. Exceptions to this loan
        structure are possible in cases of special need. ERL program loans are often
        used for such things as roof repair/replacement, plumbing repair and heater
        replacement.","emails":["dwfrederick@menlopark.org"],"faxes":[{"number":"650
