        Established in 1969 to provide diversion services for first-time youth offenders,
        we now offer outpatient mental health services in our three clinics (Youth
        Service Bureaus) and school-based counseling and support in over 50 schools
        throughout San Mateo County. We are partners with the San Mateo County of
        Education, eight school districts, five police departments, and County Departments
        of Behavioral Health and Recovery Services, Human Services, and Juvenile Probation.
        We specialize in counseling for youth and families, nurturing safe school
        environments, delivering prevention programs for at-risk youth, and parent
        support. Our programs help individuals and families cope with life challenges,
        such as traumatic experiences, depression, school related issues, high-risk
        adolescent behaviors, and mental illness. The YSBs became a part of the YMCA
        Association of San Francisco 20 year ago and operate fiscally under their
