        free  primary and specialty medical and dental services to uninsured, low-income
        residents. \r\n\r\nWho is Treated? \r\nPatients of our clinics are the working
        poor. They tend to earn just enough income to be ineligible for Medi-Cal coverage,
        yet do not receive health insurance through their employers and cannot afford
        to pay for \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d health insurance. Often these residents
        are forced to seek treatment at local emergency rooms and become saddled with
        medical bills that they are unable to pay. Samaritan House\u2019s Free Medical
        Clinics fill this gap in healthcare access for the uninsured and save emergency
        room resources for emergencies.\r\n\r\nProfessional Medical & Dental Volunteers\r\nThanks
        to its innovative volunteer-based model of service, Samaritan House\u2019s
        clinics are able to treat such a large number of patients with a very small
        paid staff. Almost all of the medical and dental doctors and assistants are
        volunteering their time free of charge. These individuals, either retired
        or currently practicing medicine and dentistry, want to serve their community
        in their limited spare time.","emails":["info@samaritanhousesanmateo.org"],"faxes":[{"number":"650
