        School Bell is a volunteer service that provides two complete sets of new
        clothes for a child in the San Mateo-Foster City, Redwood City or Millbrae
        school districts or San Bruno Belle Aire School. After checking with parent,
        all referrals should be made to the school principal, nurse or school social
        worker who then refers to Operation School Bell. This service is available
        only during the school year and children are transported from the school to
        the clothing outlet. The Turnstyle Shop, 60 North B Street, San Mateo, is
        a resale shop for used clothing, small appliances and household items. Receipts
        from the shop support community service efforts of the Assistance League and
        Peninsula Auxiliary for Children. Friendly Visiting Service is no longer in
