        a continuum of services for older adults and adults with disabilities. Centralized
        Intake serves as the single point of entry to adult services within Aging
        and Adult Services and provides referrals to community-based social support
        programs.   Adult Protective Services is a function of Centralized Intake.
        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves
        individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their
        public benefits. In-Home Supportive Services provides assistance with personal
        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,
        appointed by and under the authority and direction of the Superior Court,
        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding
        for a variety of programs, advocates on behalf of older persons and provides
        long-range planning, coordination, and program development for programs and
        services for older adults. The New Beginning Coalition (650-573-3527) is a
        broad-based group of providers and consumers that works in partnership with
        Aging and Adult Services and other organizations to improve the quality of
        life of older persons and adults with disabilities. Other programs include
        the Commission on Aging and the Commission on Disabilities (described separately).","emails":["lmancini@smcgov.org"],"faxes":[{"number":"650

        a continuum of transitional residential and vocational day training programs
        for individuals who have developmental disabilities such as mental retardation,
        cerebral palsy, epilepsy or autism. FHAR programs emphasize experiencing the
        daily routine and rhythm of a well-balanced life including social relationships,
        proper diet, exercise, leisure, employment, financial planning and maintenance
        of one''s environment. Acquisition of independent living and life skills is
        a primary goal for all FHAR consumers.         FHAR''s residential continuum
        includes eight licensed adult residential facilities. Reflecting the belief
        that consumers should reside in the least restrictive environment, FHAR''s
        residential services involve gradually decreasing levels of staff support
        while increasing levels of client independence. Independent Living and Supported
        Living Services provides indefinite support services and training to consumers
        living in their own apartment, FHAR''s eight Independent Group Residences
        or FHAR''s Berkshire apartment complex. The Adult Day Program is a pre-vocational
        program for 42 consumers who have behavioral/emotional challenges that prevent
        their successful participation within standard vocational programs. The purpose
        of this program is to prepare the participants with the necessary skills to
        use existing community services and to move from this highly structured community
        day treatment program to a less restrictive one. The Employment Support Services
        program is a community-based day program for 60 consumers. It emphasizes independent
        living skills acquisition, vocational skills acquisition and employment opportunities
        or volunteer experiences with non-disabled peers. Clients are integrated into
        the work force and continuously supported and supervised by FHAR staff to
        ensure successful and long-term placement.","emails":["fhar@fhar.org"],"faxes":[{"number":"650
