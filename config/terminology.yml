# Show informational terminology definition boxes for certain keyword
# searches. This can be helpful for such things as providing a definition
# for the federal SNAP program when the user searches for "food stamps,"
# for example.
#
# To create an entry follow this format:
#
# '<main-keyword>' :
#   synonymns :
#     - '<synonymn1>'
#     - '<synonymn2>'
#     - '<synonymn3 ... >'
#   title: '<title for this term>'
#   description :
#     '<description of this term>'
#   url : '<where to go for more info>'
#
# The <main-keyword> and all the entries under 'synonyms'
# will be keywords the user can search for to display the
# info box.
#
# The info (title, description, url) will be fed into the
# partial at app/views/component/terminology/_template.html.haml
#
# You can override the template partial by providing your
# own partial in the app/views/component/terminology/ directory.
# Give it the name _<main-keyword>.html.haml, with underscores
# in place of spaces in the name. Such as _market_match.html.haml,
# or _wic.html.haml.
#
# NOTE: enter all keywords and synonyms in lowercase in this file
# to avoid a keyword not being registered. When the user searches
# their entered keyword case will not matter.
