#SMC-Connect

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smcgov/SMC-Connect.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smcgov/SMC-Connect) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/smcgov/SMC-Connect/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/smcgov/SMC-Connect)

[SMC-Connect](http://www.smc-connect.org) is a Ruby on Rails app that makes it easy to find human services, farmers' markets, and other community organizations in San Mateo County, California. The website is powered by the [Ohana API](http://ohanapi.org) platform.

In San Mateo County, there are three Ohana apps: SMC-Connect, the [San Mateo County API](https://github.com/smcgov/ohana-api-smc) (that feeds the data to SMC-Connect), and the [admin interface](https://github.com/smcgov/SMC-Connect-Admin) that allows people to update the data.

## Stack Overview

* Ruby version 2.1.1
* Rails version 3.2.17
* Template Engines: ERB and HAML
* Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Capybara and PhantomJS (via Poltergeist gem), JasmineJS installed but not currently used (via Teaspoon gem)


## Installation
Please note that the instructions below have only been tested on OS X. If you are running another operating system and run into any issues, feel free to update this README, or open an issue if you are unable to resolve installation issues.

###Prerequisites

#### Git, Ruby 2.1+, Rails 3.2.17+ (+ Homebrew on OS X)
**OS X**: [Set up a dev environment on OS X with Homebrew, Git, RVM, Ruby, and Rails](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

**Windows**: Try [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org), along with some of these [tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+rails+on+windows) if you get stuck.

**Linux**:

* [RVM](http://rvm.io) is great, and this project uses it, but in any case, try to use the same ruby version as listed in the .ruby-version file. If you install it, it'll take care of making sure you have the right ruby, and let you focus on contributing to the app.
* You need a Javascript runtime. We recommend Node.JS (if you have a good reason not to use it, [there are other options](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs)). On Ubuntu, it's as simple as <code>sudo apt-get install nodejs</code>. On others, [check the official instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

#### PhantomJS
[Installation instructions](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs) for Mac, Linux, and Windows

### Clone the app on your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/smcgov/SMC-Connect.git smc-connect
    cd smc-connect

### Install the dependencies:

    bundle

### Set up the environment variables
Inside the `config` folder, you will find a file named `application.example.yml`. Rename it to `application.yml` and double check that it has been added to your `.gitignore` file (it should be by default).

By default, the app is configured to point to the San Mateo County API at `http://ohanapi.herokuapp.com/api`.

### Run the app
Start the app locally using Unicorn:

    unicorn -p 4000

Ohana SMC should now be running at [http://lvh.me:4000](http://lvh.me:4000)

Please make sure you are using `lvh.me` instead of `localhost` to be able to test the translation feature. Read more about [lvh.me](http://matthewhutchinson.net/2011/1/10/configuring-subdomains-in-development-with-lvhme).

### Test the app
To test locally, you can run tests with this simple command:

    rspec

To configure RSpec output formatting (for example, to provide command line output in color), create a file called `.rspec` at the root of the project, and add one option per line, such as:

    --color
    --format documentation

Options for the format configuration are `progress` (default - shows a series of dots), `documentation`, `html`, or `textmate`. [More information can be found on the RSpec website](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/2-0/docs/configuration/read-command-line-configuration-options-from-files).

For faster tests:

    gem install zeus
    zeus start #in a separate Terminal window or tab
    zeus rspec spec

To see the actual tests, browse through the [spec](https://github.com/smcgov/SMC-Connect/tree/master/spec) directory.

## Contributing

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by using alpha, beta, and prerelease versions
* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by suggesting labels for our issues
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing specifications
* by writing code (**no patch is too small**: fix typos, add comments, clean up
  inconsistent whitespace)
* by refactoring code
* by closing [issues](https://github.com/smcgov/SMC-Connect/issues)
* by reviewing patches

## Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/smcgov/SMC-Connect/issues) to track bugs and features. Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) that includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system. Ideally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. **Fork:** [Fork the repository][fork] to create a copy on your GitHub account.
2. **Branch:** [Create a topic branch][branch]; your version of the code that you'll edit.
3. **Spec:** Add testing specs for your unimplemented feature or bug fix in the `/spec/` directory.
4. **Test to fail:** Run `rspec`. If your specs pass, return to **step 3**. In the spirit of Test-Driven Development, you want to write a failing test first, then implement the feature or bug fix to make the test pass.
5. **Implement:** Implement your feature or bug fix.
6. **Test to pass:** Run `rspec`. If your specs fail, return to **step 5**.
7. _(If applicable)_ **Clean up Ruby code:** Run `metric_fu -r`. This will go through all the files in the app and analyze the code quality and check for things like trailing whitespaces and hard tabs. When it's done, it will open a page in your browser with the results. Click on `Cane` and `Rails Best Practices` to check for files containing trailing whitespaces and hard tabs. If you use Sublime Text 2, you can use the [TrailingSpaces](https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces) plugin to highlight the trailing whitespaces and delete them. If the report complains about "hard tabs" in a file, change your indentation to `spaces` by clicking on `Tabs: 2` at the bottom of your Sublime Text 2 window, then selecting `Convert Indentation to Spaces`. As for the code itself, we try to follow [GitHub's Ruby styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).
8. _(If applicable)_ **Clean up JavaScript code:** Run `rake jshint` to check JavaScript code quality.
9. **Commit changes:** Add, commit, and push your changes.
10. **Pull request:** [Submit a pull request][pr] to send your changes to this repository for review.
