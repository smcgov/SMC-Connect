If you found outdated information on smc-connect.org, did you know that you can easily update it yourself, as long as you're a member of that organization? Here's how:

1. Create an account on the site below, using your work email address:

https://admin.smc-connect.org/sign_up

2. You will then receive an email with a link to confirm your account. Make sure to check your spam/junk/promotion folders.

3. Once you confirm your email, you can sign in on the SMC-Connect Admin site, and you should automatically have access to locations that match your organization's email address.

Another way to edit a specific location is to look for it on www.smc-connect.org, the click on it in the search results, and then click on the "Edit" link (with the pencil icon) at the bottom right of the page. This should take you directly to the listing on the Admin site, assuming you have access to that listing.

If you've already signed up for an account on the Admin site, but you don't see listings that you should have access to, email me at moncef [at] monfresh [dot] com and I'll add you.
